Version 0.3.3 - 201406
* Published code to Github: https://github.com/flodolo/bbcodextra
* Now add-on works with content editable HTML5 elements (error reported by rnicoletto, theBox.value is null)
* Fixed linter errors in bbcodextra.js, remove unnecessary whitespaces in files
* Added script to check locales based on compare-dirs

Version 0.3.2 - 20100601
* Fixed "Color" command (broken in 0.3.1)
* Renamed variable "prefs" to "bbcodextraPrefs" to avoid conflicts with extensions that declare public variables with that name
* Added back Hebrew locale

Version 0.3.1 - 20100506
* Removed global variables, moved all JavaScript code inside bbcodextra.js and inside "bbcodextra" namespace (as suggested during AMO's review on 0.3.0)

Version 0.3.0 - 20100428
* New functionality: Custom Tags (see http://www.yetanothertechblog.com/bbcodextra/)
* Using wrapper chrome://global/content/nsUserSettings.js for preferences management
* General reorganization: moved code into specific .js files (bbcodextraPrefs.js, bbcodextraCustomTag.js), moved all images from content to skin
* Added "quit" function on the unload and moved to nsPreferences (chrome://global/content/nsUserSettings.js)
* Moved Pref Windows to prefwindow instead of dialog
* Moved global variable inside bbcodextra namespace (AMO's editor review)

Version 0.2.6.1 - 20100405
* Fixed an error in chrome.manifest that caused an XML error on Firefox/SeaMonkey localized in Hebrew (reported by Tomer Cohen of mozilla.org.il).
* Added l10n.ini file inside "locale" folder, used to do a compare-locales locally (ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Compare-locales)
* Removed unnecessary contents.rdf from all locales (ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Chrome_Registration#Old-style_contents.rdf_manifests)
* l10n:
	** updated "he-IL" localization (fixed issues with escaping)
	** moved French localization from "fr-FR" to "fr",
	** fixed wrong enconding for es-ES (bbcodextra.dtd from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8, error found thanks to compare-locales)
* Removed "code" class from css (used to change the aspect of "code" command using a green courier Font, not a great idea considering the number of themes/personas around nowadays and possible color/font conflicts)

* No new functionalities
* Overall code clean up (translated comments and variable names in English, fixed duplicated XUL IDs and CSS)
